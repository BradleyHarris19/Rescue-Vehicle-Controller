# Rescue-Vehicle-Controller
The serial controller for the Rescue Vehicle
## Outline
This is the code used for the controller of my rescue vehicle. It was a part of my Leaving Certificate Engineering course. 
## Hardware 
The controls consist of two joysticks, a three way switch and a potentiometer. All of these inputs are read by an Arduino pro micro and sent to the Arduino in the rescue vehicle over serial.
